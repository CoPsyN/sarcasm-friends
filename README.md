# Sarcasm-Friends

* The Sarcasm-Friends dataset was created from MUStARD (Castro et al., 2019).
* We selected generalizable situations from MUStARD (N=24) and collected freely given responses by 18 online participants (native English speakers).
* We showed each context and response in three different conditions (long vs. short vs. none) to 3 evaluators, who judged the level of sarcasm in the response.
* Sarcasm levels are coded from 0 to 5 (0: not at all, 1: mostly not, 2: not so much, 3: somewhat, 4: mostly, 5: completely). The evaluations were collected in the text form and subsequently coded into numbers.
* In context_code, T/F denotes contexts that were followed by sarcastic/not-sarcastic utterance in the original MUStARD dataset.

* If you use this dataset, please cite: (coming soon).
